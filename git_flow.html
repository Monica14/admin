                    FacebookTwitterLinkedinEmail Git is the most commonly used version control system today and is quickly becoming the standard
                    for version control. Git is a distributed version control system, meaning your local copy of code is
                    a complete version control repository. These fully-functional local repositories make it is easy to work
                    offline or remotely. You commit your work locally, and then sync your copy of the repository with the
                    copy on the server. This paradigm differs from centralized version control where clients must synchronize
                    code with a server before creating new versions of code.

                    Git’s flexibility and popularity make it a great choice for any team. Many developers and college graduates already know
                    how to use Git. Git’s user community has created many resources to train developers and Git’s popularity
                    make it easy to get help when you need it. Nearly every development environment has Git support and Git
                    command line tools run on every major operating system.
