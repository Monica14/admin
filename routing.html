                            AngularUI Router is a routing framework for AngularJS, which allows you to organize the parts of your interface into a state
                            machine. UI-Router is organized around states, which may optionally have routes, as well as other
                            behavior, attached.

                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    The page can only contain single ng-view on page

                                    If your SPA has multiple small components on the page that you wanted to render based on some conditions, $routeProvider
                                    fails. (to achieve that, we need to use directives like ng-include, ng-switch, ng-if,
                                    ng-show, which looks bad to have them in SPA)

                                    You can not relate between two routes like parent and child relationship.

                                    You cannot show and hide a part of the view based on url pattern.

                            <ul>
                                <li>You can have multiple
                                    <code>ui-view</code> on single page</li>
                                <li>Various views can be nested in each other and maintained by defining state in routing phase.</li>
                                <li>We can have child &amp; parent relationship here, simply like inheritance in state, also
                                    you could define sibling states.</li>
                                <li>You could change the
                                    <code>ui-view="some"</code> of state just by using absolute routing using
                                    <code>@</code> with state name.</li>
                                <li>Another way you could do relative routing is by using only
                                    <code>@</code> to change
                                    <code>ui-view="some"</code>. This will replace the
                                    <code>ui-view</code> rather than checking if it is nested or not.</li>
                                <li>Here you could use
                                    <code>ui-sref</code> to create a
                                    <code>href</code> URL dynamically on the basis of
                                    <code>URL</code> mentioned in a state, also you could give a state params in the json format.</li>
