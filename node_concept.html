                Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast and scalable network applications. Node.js
                uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive
                real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

                    <li>
                        <b>Aynchronous and Event Driven</b> All APIs of Node.js library are aynchronous that is non-blocking.
                        It essentially means a Node.js based server never waits for a API to return data. Server moves to
                        next API after calling it and a notification mechanism of Events of Node.js helps server to get response
                        from the previous API call.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Very Fast</b> Being built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine, Node.js library is very fast in
                        code execution.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Single Threaded but highly Scalable</b> Node.js uses a single threaded model with event looping.
                        Event mechanism helps server to respond in a non-bloking ways and makes server highly scalable as
                        opposed to traditional servers which create limited threads to handle requests. Node.js uses a single
                        threaded program and same program can services much larger number of requests than traditional server
                        like Apache HTTP Server.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>No Buffering</b> Node.js applications never buffer any data. These applications simply output the
                        data in chunks.
                    </li>
